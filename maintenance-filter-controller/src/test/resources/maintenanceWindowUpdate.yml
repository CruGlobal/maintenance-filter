    Our systems are currently being upgraded. Just as you have to upgrade the programs on your home computer every now and then, 
    we have to periodically do the same thing and upgrade the programs in our ministry wide systems. The difference is, where at 
    home you can load an upgrade in 5-10 minutes, upgrading our ministry wide system can take us up to 4 days to do. We apologize 
    for any inconvenience this is for you. The system should be back online by 8:00 AM Tuesday October 12th. If you'd like more 
    information about the upgrade please go to 
    <a href="http://staffweb.ccci.org/news/systems-upgrade.aspx">http://staffweb.ccci.org/news/systems-upgrade.aspx</a>.
